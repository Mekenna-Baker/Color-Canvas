## Installation

Just visit our website! (https://color-canvas.onrender.com/)

## Usage

Once you're at the site, you will be presented with a homepage. From there you can either sign in to an existing account, or create a new account. Once you've logged in or have created an account you will be met with a project page. Here you can view projects made by others, and projects done by yourself! When you're on the project page, you are also presented with an option to visit the canvas page. On the canvas page there will be a canvas, along with a color wheel, and a color palette. You can choose your colors, and color away! Don't worry if you've made a mistake! We have an eraser and you can clear your canvas to start anew! When you're finished with your masterpiece, go ahead and hit upload and it will appear on the project page, under 'My Projects'.
